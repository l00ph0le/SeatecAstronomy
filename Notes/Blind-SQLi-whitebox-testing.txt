# Difficult sql injections can be hard to identify in the source code for large complex applications. 
# This is a technique to help development groups find queries being executed with a successful blind sql injection 
# (or any injection). This is specific to Microsoft SQL Server. If you have a Blind SQL Injection point and
# you are able to get the server to delay in response (ie. ';WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:29' --).
# You can identify the exact query that is being you payload is being injected into and executed by quering the SQL 
# execution plan cache.

# The query below will check SQL servers execution plan cache looking for "WAITFOR DELAY" and return any SQL queries executed 
# that include the "WAITFOR DELAY" in them. If you make your payload unique, its very easy to filter out any noise. I've used 
# this technique several times for whitebox testing on large complex code bases with thousands of programs and millions of lines 
# of code.
